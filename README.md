## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FDC2
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This will start both the frontend (port 5174) and backend API server (port 3001).

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start frontend development server
- `npm run dev:full` - Start both frontend and backend servers
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run server` - Start backend API server
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for responsive styling
- **Font Awesome** icons for enhanced UI

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express** REST API server
- **SQLite** database with mortar and ballistic data
- **CORS** enabled for cross-origin requests

### PWA Features
- Service worker for offline caching

- Application information and version details

## MGRS Support

The application uses the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) for all coordinate inputs:
- Full validation of MGRS grid formats
- Distance and azimuth calculations
- Support for all UTM zones and grid squares

## Offline Functionality

- All calculations run client-side for offline capability
- Ballistic data cached in localStorage
- Service worker caches static assets and API responses
- Graceful degradation when offline

## Mobile Support

- Responsive design adapts to all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements
